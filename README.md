# Yield

Concatenative live coding language that yields

## Tenets

1. Code is data
2. Data is state
3. State is mutable
4. Mutable is fun
5. Immutable is also fun
6. Until it is not
7. Just make it mutable again
8. This is no joke
9. Just for fun
10. Yield for joy

## Contribution

You or AI can contribute anytime. Just don't break any tests and always create new ones for new operators. There are already plenty but never enough.
